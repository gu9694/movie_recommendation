## Description
We use Big Query in Google Cloud Platform as Database, google does not allow us to upload the credentials, so if you need the credentials, please contact us. The entire web application is in fold movie_recommendation, run zlktqa.py, then open the website shown in the console. If something wrong happened, then the reason is lack of package or lack of my google credentials. You need to set up your own database with the data we provide.
